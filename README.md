 ### **`My Bio`**
It is An Nguyen - a Vietnamese nerd (or almost so ðŸ˜…). I am currently at the end of my PhD journey at Dublin City University, Ireland.
My research topic is associated with financial markets, mainly focusing on cryptocurrencies, stocks and ETFs. With this being said, my work can be briefly categorized into two main paths:
+ Data Analytics:
   + Time-varying correlation patterns between financial assets. Specifically, the correlation between financial assets is measured by similarity metrics on price movements, (i.e. Pearson, Spearman, Kendall Tau, etc). Consequently, the correlation in financial markets is observed over time, so special patterns can be spotted. The results obtained from my experiments are linked to different aspects, such as the market capitalization of assets, types of investment vehicle, financial events (economic crisis, bear market, bull market, political conflict, etc), investor behavior (i.e. purchase, sell, herding, diversify portfolio).
   + The influence of each asset on the financial markets, i.e. how the price movements of an asset  proportionally cause other assets' price movements. The highlight of this experiment is to find the most influential assets, i.e. assets that hugely impact the markets.
   + Herding behavior of investors: how often do investors perform a herding phenomenon in a market? What is the difference/similarity in herding behavior between different types of investment vehicle? Which type of investment vehicle is most sensitive to herding behavior? herding patterns in each type of investment vehicle.
+ Forecasting:
   + Forecasting future prices and movements of financial assets.

Apart from PhD work, I am also tutoring and lecturing several modules:
+ Statistical Data Analysis
+ Mathematical Methods
+ Project Planning and Communication Skills
+ Building Complex Computational Models
+ R programming

Last but not least, I am working as a data analyst at a wonderful company (I mean ... I really enjoy it ðŸ˜š)
